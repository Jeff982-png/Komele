# Project Overview

This repository contains three Python modules designed for MQTT communication and JSON data processing. Each file serves a specific purpose, as outlined below:

## File Descriptions

### 1. `main.py`
This is the primary script for the project. It serves as the entry point and coordinates interactions between the various modules. The `main.py` file contains the main application logic to:

- Initialize and configure the MQTT client.
- Manage incoming and outgoing MQTT messages.
- Process JSON data received from MQTT topics.

### 2. `mqtt.py`
This module handles MQTT communication, abstracting the connection details and providing an easy-to-use interface for publishing and subscribing to topics. Key features include:

- Connecting to an MQTT broker.
- Publishing messages to specific topics.
- Subscribing to and receiving messages from topics.
- Logging for debugging and monitoring.

### 3. `get_json.py`
This module focuses on processing and validating JSON data. It provides utility functions to:

- Parse JSON strings into Python dictionaries.
- Validate JSON structures against predefined schemas.
- Extract and format data for use in the main application.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Required libraries specified in `requirements.txt` (if not available, create one by listing all dependencies).
- An MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) for testing the MQTT functionalities.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the MQTT broker settings in `main.py` or `mqtt.py` as needed.

## Usage

1. Start the main application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Ensure the MQTT broker is running and configured to communicate with the application.

3. Monitor logs for any errors or messages to verify successful operation.
